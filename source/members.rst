PyPA Members, And How To Join
=============================

:Last Reviewed: 2020-07-20

Historically, the PyPA was a loose confederation of people
and projects; the word "authority" in the name was meant to be
a joke. :pep:`609` formalizes the PyPA somewhat and clarifies
membership and governance rules.

.. _`Does not require membership`:

Does not require membership
---------------------------

Anyone is welcome to (while following licensing terms) use PyPA projects.

Anyone is welcome to (while following the :ref:`Code of Conduct`)
contribute patches, bug reports, feature requests, ideas, questions,
answers, and similar information in our `GitHub organization`_ and
`Bitbucket organization`_ repositories, and discuss issues and plans
with us in `the Packaging category on discuss.python.org`_ and on `the
distutils-sig mailing list`_.

.. _`Project membership`:

Project membership
------------------

The PyPA member projects are those listed within our `GitHub organization`_
and `Bitbucket organization`_.

Per :pep:`609`, any existing PyPA member can propose to accept a
project into PyPA, and members vote to decide whether to accept that
proposal. Criteria include the project adopting the PyPA's :ref:`Code
of Conduct` and the project being relevant to Python packaging, as
determined by existing members of PyPA.

To request PyPA project membership, start a thread on
`the Packaging category on discuss.python.org`_ or on `the
distutils-sig mailing list`_ requesting such a vote.


.. _`Individual membership`:

Individual membership
---------------------

Maintainership of a project that is under the PyPA organization
automatically transfers individual membership in the PyPA. The PyPA
individual members are those who have maintainer status (also known as
committer status or write permissions) or triage permissions on any
projects within the PyPA `GitHub organization`_ or `Bitbucket
organization`_. Currently there is no public list of all PyPA
individual members.

Per :pep:`609`, to become an individual member of the PyPA, you can do
either of the following:

1. attain PyPA project membership for your project (for which you are already a maintainer)
2. attain maintainership or triage permissions in a project that is already a PyPA member project

PyPA member projects each make their own decisions regarding granting
maintainer and triager rights to individuals.
