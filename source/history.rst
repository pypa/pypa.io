2015
----

  <pypug:Source Distribution (or "sdist")>` (`pip release notes`_).

  ``--global-option`` per requirement in requirement files (`pip release notes`_).

  accepted.

2014
----

* :ref:`pypug:setuptools` v8.0 and :ref:`pypug:pip` v6.0 (`pip release
  notes`_) implemented :pep:`440` (Python's new versioning scheme).
  Both projects now depend on the project :ref:`pypug:packaging` for
  this support.
* :pep:`477` backported :pep:`453` into Python 2.7.9.
* :pep:`453`: Being able to bootstrap ``pip`` into Python 3.4.

  python.org.
* :ref:`virtualenv` (v1.11) started installing pip & setuptools using wheels.
* :ref:`pip` (v1.5.1) became available as a cross platform wheel on
  PyPI (`pip release notes`_).
* :ref:`pip` (v1.5.1) stop requiring :ref:`setuptools` to install
  wheels (`pip release notes`_).
* ``get-pip.py`` doesn't require setuptools to be installed first
* ``get-pip.py`` installs setuptools for you, if you don't already have it
* :pep:`449`: Removal of the DNS based mirror autodiscovery
* `Refactored the pip docs <https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/1556>`_ to be
  consistent with the `"PyPA Standard Docs Template"
  <https://gist.github.com/qwcode/8431828>`_
* PyPUG moved to the packaging.python.org subdomain.
* :pep:`440` published to standardise version descriptions and filtering.

2013
----

* :ref:`distlib` started releasing to PyPI, and :ref:`pip` began
  depending on it (`pip release notes`_).
* Core PyPI infrastructure relocated to OSU/OSL (with significantly
  increased resources)
* The core packaging projects were collected under the :term:`Python Packaging Authority
  (PyPA)` accounts on `GitHub <https://github.com/pypa>`_ and `Bitbucket
  <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/>`_ [2]_
* Distribute merged back into :ref:`setuptools`, and :ref:`setuptools` development
  migrated to the PyPA BitBucket account. [1]_ [5]_
* PyPI started supporting clients using verified SSL with standard cert bundles.
* PyPI forced web users over to SSL.
* :ref:`pip` (v1.3) and :ref:`easy_install <setuptools>` (v0.7) use
  verified SSL by default (`pip release notes`_)
* easy_install supports additional hashes beyond md5 (pip already did)
* `Fastly CDN enabled`_ for PyPI (donated)
* Restructured the `pip install docs
  <http://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_ to clarify that
  setuptools and pip are the "base" of the bootstrapping hierarchy
* setuptools available as a cross platform wheel on PyPI
* :pep:`438` and the associated pip changes.
* :ref:`pip` (v1.4) added support for building and installing :term:`wheels
  <Wheel>` (`pip release notes`_)
* :term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)>` became the maintainer for the
  `Python Packaging User Guide`_, which was forked from the "Hitchhiker's Guide
  to Packaging".
* Packaging Dev and User Summits were held at Pycon 2013 to share ideas on the
  future of packaging. [3]_ [4]_
* :pep:`425` and :pep:`427` were accepted.  Together,
  they specify a built-package format for Python called :term:`Wheel`.

Before 2013
-----------

**2012-06-19**: The effort to include "Distutils2/Packaging" in Python 3.3 was
abandoned due lack of involvement. [6]_

**2011-02-28**: The :term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)>` is created
to take over the maintenance of :ref:`pip` and :ref:`virtualenv` from Ian Bicking,
led by Carl Meyer, Brian Rosner and Jannis Leidel. Other proposed names were
"ianb-ng", "cabal", "pack" and "Ministry of Installation".

**2008**: `distribute`_ was forked from :ref:`setuptools` by Tarek Ziade, in an
effort to create a more open project.

**2008**: :ref:`pip` was introduced by Ian Bicking as an alternative to
``easy_install`` (the installer included with :ref:`setuptools`)

**2007**: :ref:`virtualenv` was introduced by Ian Bicking, which allowed users
to create isolated Python environments based on a central system installation of
Python.

**2006**: :ref:`buildout` was introduced by Jim Fulton, with the goal to create
a system for repeatable installations of potentially complex projects.

**2004**: :ref:`setuptools` was introduced by Phillip Eby, which included the
:term:`Egg` format, and the ability to declare and automatically install
dependencies.

**2003**: :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>` was up and running.

**2002**: Richard Jones started work on :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index
(PyPI)>`, and created :pep:`301` to describe it.

**2001**: :pep:`241` was written to standardize the metadata for distributions.

**2000**: `catalog-sig`_ was created to discuss creating a centralized index of
distributions.

**2000**: :ref:`distutils` was added to the Python standard library in Python 1.6.

**1998**: The `distutils-sig`_ dicussion list was created to discuss the
development of :ref:`distutils`.
