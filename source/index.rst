Python Packaging Authority
==========================


The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a working group that maintains many of
the relevant projects in Python packaging.

The software developed through the PyPA is used to package, share, and install
Python software and to interact with indexes of downloadable Python software
such as `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_, the Python Package Index.

They host projects on `GitHub <https://github.com/pypa>`_ and
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/pypa>`_, and discuss issues in `the
Packaging category on discuss.python.org
<https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging>`_ and on the `pypa-dev
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypa-dev>`_ and
`distutils-sig
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig>`_ mailing
lists.

For a listing of their most important projects, see :ref:`the key projects list
<pypug:pypa_projects>`.
