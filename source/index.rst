The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a working group that maintains a core
set of projects used in Python packaging.

The software developed through the PyPA is used to package, share, and install
Python software and to interact with indexes of downloadable Python software
such as `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_, the Python Package Index. Click the logo below to download pip, the most prominent software used to interact with PyPI.

The PyPA publishes the `Python Packaging User Guide
<https://packaging.python.org>`_ as the authoritative resource on how to
package, publish, and install Python projects using current tools. The User
Guide provides a user introduction to packaging and use of these
tools. As a service to Python users who may need to package Python with other
languages (a common example is scientific Python packages), the user guide also
offers basic information and links to available third party packaging options
(for example, `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_).

The PyPA hosts projects on `GitHub <https://github.com/pypa>`_ and
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/pypa>`_, and discusses issues in `the
Packaging category on discuss.python.org
<https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging>`_ and on the `pypa-dev
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypa-dev>`_ and
`distutils-sig
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig>`_ mailing
lists.

<pypug:pypa_projects>`.
